Product segmentation refers to the activity of grouping products that have similar characteristics and serve a similar market. It is usually related to marketing (Sales Categories) or manufacturing (Production Processes).
However, as a Logistics Manager, you rarely care about the product itself when managing goods flows; except for the dangerous and oversized products.

Your attention is mainly focused on the sales volumes distribution (fast/slow movers), demand variability and delivery lead time.

You want to put efforts into managing products that have:
- The highest contribution to your total turnover: ABC Analysis
- The most unstable demand: Demand Variability

### Medium Article
In this [Medium Article](https://towardsdatascience.com/product-segmentation-for-retail-with-python-c85cc0930f9a), we will introduce simple statistical tools to combine ABC Analysis and Demand 
Variability to perform products segmentation.
